# Butterflies of Britain Website

Butterflies are a natural beauty that are underappreciated by many people.  This website will aim to help users to name some of the more common butterflies that they may see in their garden or in local parks.<br>
It will provide users with the images and names of several common butterflies in Britain, and will then lead to a ‘Simon Says’-based memory game that will test their knowledge of the butterflies’ names.

UX
------------------------------
This website is aimed for anyone who is wanting to become familiar with common butterflies that they may see.  It is only focused on the names of common butterflies; it is assumed that with this information, people wanting more would then be able to use those names to investigate other sources further.

------------------------------
### User Stories
As a individual wanting to learn more about butterflies, I want to:
* Be introduced to the names of several types of butterfly.
* Be tested on the types of butterfly I have been introduced to.
* Contact the owner of the website if necessary.

As a developer, I want:
* To gain more knowledge on the use of JavaScript to enhance interactivity of websites.	
* To entertain both myself and the end-user in the process of testing the names of butterflies.
* For users to be able to contact me for questions or feedback on the website.

### Wireframes
Balsamiq was used to design the wireframes for this project.  As the project was developed, the original design of a five-page website was redesigned to a three-page website to streamline and simplify the experience.

## Redesigned wireframes

By amending the website, it means fewer clicks for the user, and a simpler, more satisfying experience.

# Design
------------------------------
* Basic colours of black and grey were used for text colours and tables, to ensure contrast was high and easily legible.  
* White text was used when needed over images to ensure font was easily legible.
* The font Nunito from Google Fonts was chosen as it is clean, clear and basic, without being overly ostentatious. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case Nunito does not load correctly.
